## Recommendations

1) Largest portion of the marketing budget should be spent on North American region as this market (Sales USD 1,113m / 44% of Global Market Sales) represents the largest game console market
2) Unless a gaming company is able to carve out a niche market, the safer option is to focus effort in the devlopment of either one of the top four best selling console gaming gener (i.e. action, shooter, sports and role-playing)
3)
