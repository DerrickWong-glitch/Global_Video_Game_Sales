* Unless the gaming company can carve out a niche market, the safer option is to focus effort on the development of game for the top four best-selling genre (i.e., action, shooter, sports and role-playing) - over 70% of console games sold are in one of these four genres
* Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo dominate the platform for console gaming. It is extremely vital that gaming companies work closely and maintain good relationship these three gaming platform companies.
